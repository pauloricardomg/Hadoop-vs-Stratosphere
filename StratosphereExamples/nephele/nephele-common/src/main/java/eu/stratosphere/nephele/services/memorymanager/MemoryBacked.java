/**
 * Base class for memory backed objects. This class should be implemented by all objects depending on (possibly more
 * than one) {@link MemorySegment}s during their life span.
 * <p>
 * {@code MemoryBacked} objects are injected with the required {@code
 * MemorySegment}s from an external memory management component via the {@link MemoryBacked#bind(MemorySegment)} method.
 * A bound {@code MemoryBacked} object is fully functional at least until the backing memory is exhausted (in which case
 * an {@link OutOfMemoryException} is thrown or some other indication is given to the client), or the client unbinds the
 * attached memory via the {@link MemoryBacked#unbind()} method. A method call of a public method functional only in a
 * bound state results in an {@link UnboundMemoryBackedException}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please note that memory access is generally not concurrent, i.e. possible inconsistencies caused by concurrent access
 * to the same memory segment must be handled by the client.
 * </p>
