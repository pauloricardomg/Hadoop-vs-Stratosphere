/**
 * This class defines the output contracts, realized as java annotations. To use
 * an output contract, simply add the annotation above the class declaration of
 * the class that realized the user function. For example, to declare the
 * <i>SameKey</i> output contract for a map-type function, use it the following
 * way:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * \@OutputContract.SameKey
 * public class MyMapper extends MapStub<N_Integer, N_String, N_Integer, N_String>
 * {
 *     protected void map(N_Integer key, N_String value, Collector<N_Integer, N_String> out)
 *     {
 *        String s = value.toString();
 *        
 *        if (s.contains("...some text...") {
 *            out.collect(key, value);
 *        }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
